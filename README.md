#OpenLauncher

A fork of [Launcher3](https://github.com/geecko86/Launcher3) designed to mimic the Google Now Launcher with an open source philosophy.

The project started on June 30th.

Has been implemented so far:
* A custom screen at the left of the workspace, where the user can make searches on DuckDuckGo and, in the future, get cards
* A search bar at the top of the workspace
* Search suggestions by Google pop up as the user types his search query

In the future, will be implemented:

* Voice queries
* Integration of WolframAlpha & the DuckDuckGo API for instant answers
* Cards Ã  la Google Now
* A settings screen
* The Ability to choose a search provider
* A nice framework so that it's easy to develop new cards
* & More to come
