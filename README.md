#OpenLauncher

A fork of [Launcher3](https://github.com/geecko86/Launcher3) designed to mimic the Google Now Launcher with an open source philosophy.

The project started on June 30th. Right now the only thing implemented is a working search screen at the left of your home screen. The screen displays a basic DuckDuckGo search bar with suggestions from Google.

In the future, will be implemented:

* The Ability to choose a search provider
* A search bar at the top of your wallpaper
* Voice queries
* Integration of WolframAlpha & the DuckDuckGo API for instant answers
* A settings screen
* Cards Ã  la Google Now
* A nice framework so that it's easy to develop new cards
* & More to come
